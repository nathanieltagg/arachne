Servers that serve json descriptions of events from either reco or dst files.

Relevant files for the reco file-based server:

build-server-reco.sh
--------------------

Checks out and builds the reco file server, which lives in a
poorly-named package in Personal/rodriges. The script should be run as
minervapro. To change the software version used, modify the
mnvsoftVersion variable in the script, and make the same change in
ntuple-server-reco.sh

ntuple-server-reco.sh
---------------------

Runs the reco file server, which involves setting up the appropriate
version of the minerva software and then running SystemTestsApp with
an appropriate options file.


I haven't documented the DST file-based server, because I didn't write it.
