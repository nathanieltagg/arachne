scaTo split a game, use:
sed -n 1,100p input.game > output.game
This takes lines 1-100 inclusive (100 lines total)


To make the final cut:

create table scan_final
select tscans.* 
 from ( 
       select  user_name,det,recoVer,run,subrun,gate,slice,max(modification_date) as recdate from tscans 
       group by user_name,det,recoVer,run,subrun,gate,slice ) as t1 
          inner join tscans 
          on ( t1.user_name=tscans.user_name 
             AND t1.det=tscans.det 
             AND t1.recoVer=tscans.recoVer 
             AND t1.run=tscans.run 
             AND t1.subrun=tscans.subrun 
             AND t1.gate=tscans.gate 
             AND t1.slice=tscans.slice 
             AND t1.recdate=tscans.modification_date)
	 where tscans.recoVer = "v7r0p1";
